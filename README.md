# Ganyem

## Overview
Ganyem is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that aims to serve as a restaurant catalog to help users browse restaurants, find menus, post a reviews and save their favorite restaurants. The web application has native-like capabilities, allowing it to be installed and accessed even in situations with slow or no internet connection like a smartphone application.

In addition to its native-like capabilities, Ganyem also features a responsive web design that ensures optimal display and usability across various devices. It prioritizes accessibility, making the app usable for a wide range of users, including those with disabilities. The application is designed to be easily maintained, allowing for efficient updates and enhancements. It also supports automated testing, enabling seamless and reliable testing processes. Lastly, Ganyem is optimized for performance, delivering fast and smooth user interactions.

After completing the intermediate class in the front-end learning path, I successfully passed and continued my learning in the advanced class provided by the [IDCamp 2022](https://idcamp.ioh.co.id/) program from Indosat Ooredoo Hutchison. 

This web application serves as the final project consisting of 3 submissions and serves as the determinant for completion of the ["Menjadi Front-End Web Developer Expert"](https://www.dicoding.com/academies/219) class at Dicoding and the overall completion of the IDCamp 2022 program.
